# Hardware Revisions

This directory contains documentation and design files for the Data Gator PCB designs.

In principle, each hardware revision directory will have the following:

1. Electrical schematic as a PDF,
2. Bill of Materials (BOM) as a spreadsheet,
3. 3D Model of the physical board and components for design of cases,
4. Assembly automation files for contracting assembly through 3rd party.
