This directory contains the files supplied to PCBWay for ordering Data Gator v1.5 board fabrication and assembly service.

The file named `Aggregator Schematic v315_top_cpl.csv` contains the automation file for placing components on the top of the board.

`Aggregator Schematic v315_top_bom.csv` contains the preliminary bill of materials submitted to the company for the quotation. Note that after working with the engineers a corrected version was made. That is the third and final design file in this directory.


Using the gerber files in the directory above, you can order board fabrication. Submit the files in this directory to have components placed and soldered onto the board by PCBWay.
