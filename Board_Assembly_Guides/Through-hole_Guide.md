# Through-Hole Guide
![[Hardware/images/dg_board_tour.png]]

Above is a map of the various components on the Data Gator. The following are through hole components that generally must be soldered:

1. Fuel Gauge
2. 3.3V Analog Sensors
3. I2C ports

Each of these components are simple to attach using the picture above as an orientation guide.

>[!note]
>The analog and I2C ports have a plastic alignment pin on the bottom which must be trimmed off before soldering to the board. A good tool for this is a pair of flush cutters.
