Below is a list of the components used in our box build:

| Component | Cost | 
| :---: | :---: | 
| [Qilipsu Box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085QCT543?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share&th=1) | $26.99 | 
| [Qilipsu Cable Gland](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZRH3V59?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) | $10.99 | 
| [u.FL to SMA Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H3P9KDQ?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) | $10.99 |
| [JST PH Connector Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097BVPB38/ref=ewc_pr_img_2?smid=A2WB8VY980GP2P&psc=1) | $9.79 | 
| [WiFi Antenna](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TTY8W2Y?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_9A5KHG0H4P9HB2RVQRNM)| $7.99 |

This places the cost of building an enclosure at around $60 dollars.

# Build Procedure
1. Mount Data Gator to mounting plate. Hexagonal plastic standoffs with M3 threading were used to mount the Data Gator in the example above. To connect the standoffs to the mounting plate 1/4" holes were drilled into the plate and then super glue was used to secure the standoffs in the holes. Note that fast setting glue is recommended for this process.
2. Next mount the u.FL to SMA adapter by drilling another hole in the side of the box. Use the mounting hardware (lock rings and nut) to mount the SMA adapter in the hole. For waterproofing, applying a silicone caulk is recommended.
3. To mount the battery, adhesive velcro was used and placed on the wall of the box.
4. Finally, mount the cable glands by drilling holes in the side of the box. We found a step drill bit to be the fastest and most effective way of doing this. Other methods tend to be messy.
